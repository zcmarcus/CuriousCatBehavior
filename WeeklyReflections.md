## Weekly Reflections

#### Week 0  (*Week of 01/13/2020*)

###### Individual Project
    No tangible work done on the individual project this week. Began brainstorming for topics
    at various times during the week when I had some idle time on my hands (e.g. stuck in traffic). - (1.5 Hrs)

###### Enterprise Java work
    [1/15/2020]: In order to jump back into the fray feeling somewhat prepared, I made sure to get my dev
    environment set up and tested this week. - (1.5 hrs)
    
    [1/19/2020]: Took my time working through Week 1 exercise, being sure to poke around in Maven to get a better
    feel for dependency management, goals, etc. - (1.5 hrs)

#### Week 1 (*Week of 01/20/2020*)

###### Individual Project
    
    [1/21/2020, 1/25/2020, 1/27/2020]: Spent several days tossing around different variations on a concept
    for the indie project. I was nearly set on creating an app which would allow student developers to 
    craft personal profile pages on which they could link to current project in GitHub, detail current
    courses and independent learning ventures, connect with other students and collaborate, and ultimately
    create a simple but effective portfolio supplement to add to their resumes. However, a day before
    our evening class on 1/28/2020, I tossed that idea out the window and decided to make an application
    centered around the sharing of videos containing strange cat behaviors. At first glance, this new concept 
    may come off as silly and kind of trivial, if not overdone in the current age of the internet, but I
    believe it has something unique to offer a number of pet owners and internet users. I developed the
    idea to the extent that I could share a feasible MVP during my elevator pitch during this week's class. - (1.5 hrs)
    

###### Enterprise Java work

    [1/22/2020]: Pulled down Week 2 exercise and got the application working. Added code to UserData allowing
    for user searches based on first name, last name and username. - (1.5 hrs)
    
    [1/23/2020]: Brushed up on git commands and completed Activity 2, which offered
    additional practice with git.
    
    [1/26/2020]: Completed Week 2 exercise - (1 hr) 
    

#### Week 2 (*Week of 01/27/2020*)

###### Individual Project

    [1/28/2020]: Created git repo for project and completed some initial project set up. - (0.5 hrs)

    [1/29/2020]: Added README, Weekly Reflections (this document), and 
    Project Plan to project. Added journal entries documenting work done up until
    this point.
    
###### Enterprise Java Work

    [1/29/2020]: Completed Activity 3 by initiating planning phase and adding
    link to project to IndividualProjects document in student repo. (1 hr)
    
    [2/2/2020]: Began Week 3 exercise, which offers some solid practice with unit testing (JUnit 5) 
    and logging (Log4J2).
    
#### Week 3 (*Week of 02/03/2020*)

###### Individual Project

    [2/4/2020]: Created partial Project Plan. Laid out tasks to complete for this week, including
    all parts Checkpoint 1. Having done little more than create project structure last week, this week
    will be all about crafting a concrete, detailed design and gameplan for the coming weeks. 
    
###### Enterprise Java Work

    [2/4/2020]: Completed Week 3 exercise. Feel much more comfortable writing unit tests and
    utilizing those tests to create higher-quality code. Learned at least one or two ways to test
    for exceptions in a method.
